# Mooseman Driving - Python Version

This is the original Python implementation using turtle graphics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- turtle (comes built-in with Python)

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed:
```bash
python --version
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python mooseman.py
```

## Features
- Blue square car following a chaotic driving path
- Red line trail showing the path taken
- Black roads as reference
- Static text at the top showing the Mooseman dialogue

## Controls
- The animation runs automatically
- Close the window to exit

## Notes

- Animation speed can be adjusted by changing `car.speed(1)` (1=slowest, 10=fastest)
- Path can be customized by modifying the segment values (angles and distances)
